Task 1: It seems as the number of processes go up, the higher likelihood of the processes 
being out of order.

Task 2: 
i:1 process ID:9775 parent ID:15514 child ID: 9776
i:2 process ID: 9776 parent ID: 1 child ID:9777
i:3 process ID: 9777 parent ID: 9776 child ID:9778
i:4 process ID: 9778 parent ID: 1 child ID:0

Task 3:
Out of 100 processes, 33/100 were adopted by init.

Tasks 4-8:
Started too late and could not resolve errors in my code. I will do better in 
the future.

How to run:
Type make and hit enter.
After typing ls you will see an executable named simplechain.
Type ./simplechain <number(1-100)>.
Type make clean to clear the executable files.
